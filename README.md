**Project Title:** Comprehensive Data Analysis and Visualization of Revenue and Profit Metrics  

**Objective:**  
The project aimed to uncover critical business insights by analyzing the relationship between average revenue and profit concerning total riders and time (monthly trends). Additionally, the analysis examined seasonal impacts, rider types, profit margins, and rider counts to support strategic decision-making and enhance business performance.  

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from structured datasets.  
- Power BI: For building an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights and trends.  

**Key Contributions:**  
1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**  
   - Imported raw sales data from SQL databases and ensured data integrity by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
   - Normalized the dataset to create relationships among tables and improve query efficiency.  

2. **SQL Data Analysis:**  
   - Designed complex SQL queries to calculate metrics like average revenue, profit margins, and rider counts across various dimensions (e.g., monthly, seasonally, and rider types).  
   - Analyzed the relationship between revenue and profit concerning total riders and time (monthly trends).  
   - Segmented data to explore seasonal variations and categorized revenue and profit by rider types (e.g., casual riders vs. regular subscribers).  
   - Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) such as profit margins, monthly rider growth, and seasonal revenue spikes.

3. **Dashboard Development in Power BI:**  
   - Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:  
     - **Monthly Trends:** Trends in average revenue and profit over time, highlighting correlations with rider counts.  
     - **Seasonal Patterns:** Revenue variations across different seasons to identify peak periods.  
     - **Rider Types Analysis:** Insights into the contribution of casual vs. regular riders to overall revenue and profit.  
     - **Profitability Metrics:** Profit margin comparisons across different rider demographics and seasons.  
     - **Rider Demographics:** Count of riders segmented by type and their impact on financial outcomes.  
   - Integrated slicers and filters for dynamic user interaction, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific time periods, seasons, or rider categories.  

4. **Insights and Impact:**  
   - Discovered that peak seasons significantly influence revenue and profit margins, with notable contributions from specific rider types.  
   - Identified monthly trends that helped predict revenue performance and optimize resource allocation during high-demand periods.  
   - Highlighted the impact of rider segmentation on profitability, aiding marketing teams in targeting high-value customer groups.  
   - Delivered a visually engaging and user-friendly dashboard that empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions efficiently.  

**Key Outcomes:**  
- Enhanced the understanding of revenue and profit drivers across temporal and categorical dimensions.  
- Provided actionable insights that influenced pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and operational planning.  
- Reduced time spent on manual reporting and analysis by automating visualization workflows in Power BI.
